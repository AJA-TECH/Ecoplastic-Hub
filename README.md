### Project Description
Eco Plastic Hub is an innovative platform that connects individuals and organizations with companies in need of recyclable plastics. We collect plastic waste from individuals and organizations, and then sell it to companies that use recycled materials in their production processes. By facilitating this exchange, we promote a circular economy and help reduce environmental pollution.

### The Problem statement
Plastic waste accumulation poses significant environmental and health risks, while its disposal through traditional methods (landfills, incineration) is inefficient and unsustainable. Meanwhile, companies seek affordable, high-quality recyclable materials to reduce production costs and environmental footprint.

### The Solution
At Eco Plastic Hub, we offer a simple and profitable solution. Individuals and organizations can sell their plastic waste to us, and in return, we provide competitive payment rates based on the type and weight of the plastic waste. We then collect, sort, and supply this plastic waste to companies that need recyclable materials, promoting a circular economy and reducing environmental pollution.
